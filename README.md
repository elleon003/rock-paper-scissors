# Rock Paper Scissors

*A JavaScript game created for the Odin Project Curriculum.*

V1 - Game based entirely in alerts (found in *basicAlertVersion.html*)

V2 - Same game logic with a UI

Things learned in this project:

- Always write out your plan before you start coding. It's the only way to stay on task
- Think about everything you want to happen every time an action is taken (*like clicking a button*). That really helped me refactor my original code to work in a site.
- I really don't think I'm destined for any kind of design work. I wanted to do more, but I find myself having more fun making things happen than making things look great. Mad respect to those that design.
- This is an unfinished project. I was never able to figure out how to get images to display for each side's choices, but I'm banging my head up against a wall at the moment, so I'm going to move on and come back.
